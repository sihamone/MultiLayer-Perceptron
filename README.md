Hi, I’m Siha Silva a passionate self-taught full stack analyst and an applied Mathematician from Mexico. My passion for data analysis comes from wanting to predict and make backed up decisions when relevant questions are asked. I love how my experience in tech jobs and my math career has helped me create new code as effective as possible.

I am also a passionate artist wanting to put in code my creative ideas to create incredible artworks!
